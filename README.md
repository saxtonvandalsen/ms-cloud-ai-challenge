# Cloud AI Challenge project - Image Analysis using Azure AI Computer Vision

## Project Overview:

The Cloud AI Challenge project aims to integrate image analysis capabilities using computer vision technology. Leveraging Azure cloud services, the project enables AI-powered computer vision to analyze .png and .jpg image files via their URLs. The project is implemented as a .NET 8 Blazor web application and utilizes Docker with a development container in Visual Studio Code for local deployment.

#### Key Components

- **Azure Cloud Services**: Leveraged Azure cloud services for hosting and enabling cognitive services, specifically for AI-powered computer vision.
- **Cognitive Services**: Enabled image analysis using Azure Cognitive Services, facilitating the analysis of .png and .jpg image files through their URLs.
- **.NET 8 Blazor App**: Developed as a .NET 8 Blazor web application, providing a platform for integrating the image analysis functionality into a user-friendly interface.
- **Docker**: Utilized Docker for containerization, enabling seamless deployment and portability of the web application across different environments.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Employed Visual Studio Code with a development container setup for local development and testing of the web application.
- **Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis Package**: Incorporated the Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis package to facilitate image analysis functionality within the project.

#### Work-in-Progress

Currently working on adding Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) capabilities to this project using GitHub Actions. My goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes to streamline development and ensure code quality. I plan providing updates and continually improving this project!
